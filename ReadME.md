```

- Confirms to ECMAScript specification ( commonly referred interchangeably as JS)
- Multi-paradigm ( code can be written in different ways - OOP / Functional ways etc. )
- Language of the browser
= Runs on the client/browser (frontend) as well as on the server (backend using Node.js - javascript runtime)
```
